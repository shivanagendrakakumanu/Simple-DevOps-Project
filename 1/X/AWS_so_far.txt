AWS
Elastic Compute Cloud
-	ports ssh22, http80, https443
-	used default vpc and subnets, opened http ports in security group
-	using pem key to access Ec2 instance(putty-puttygen or powershell or mobaxterm)
-	create website by installing package httpd server
Elastic Block Storage
-	two type of volume: Object(store files) and Block(os or db) storage
-	 5 types of EBS:  ST1 and SC1 are used only for storage, GP2, IO1, Standard can used for boot or storage  
Status Check
-	instance and system status check
-	1/2 means system is succeeded but instance failed(reboot instance), 0/2  means both are failed(stop instance and start again)
Simple Storage Service
-	object based storage(like google drive) where bucket names must be unique and each bucket can contain objects(files). It has 6 types of storage.
-	must know features Static Website, Versioning, Encryption, Access Control List, Bucket Policy, Transfer Acceleration(edge location), Life Cycle Management, Cross Region Replication
Identity Access Management
-	manage of level of access to AWS based on Users, Groups, Policies/Permissions, Roles(cli)
Load Balancer
-	
AutoScaling
-	
Elastic Load Balancer
-	
-	
Virtual Private Cloud
-	Networking
-	Classes of IP
-	Subnet(public and private)
-	CIDR
-	Subnet Mask
-	Elastic IP
-	Internet GateWay
-	Route Table
-	Bastian/Jump
-	NAT GateWay
-	NACL
-	InBoud and OutBound
-	StateFul and Stateless
-	Ephemeral Ports
-	Rules
-	VPC Peering
-	Transitive Peering
-	VPC Flow logs
Elastic File System
-	similar to EBS but available only in linux. share volume to multiple instances by mount and mount point by only available at AZs level not across regions.
Cloud Watch
-	monitoring tool to monitor disk, cpu percent…. Create Dashboard & billing alarm etc
Simple Notification Service
-	topic(group) and subscriber(member email) to send notifications. 
-	it's a push based delivery system, ex: integrate in Auto Scaling it will send email
Route 53
-	can create DNS for servers and be used for failover at regional level.
-	Health Check, Alarms, Notifications
-	policies distributed the traffic between regions; 5 types are Simple, Weighted, Latency, FailOver, GeoLocation; default policy is Simple
Relational DataBase Service(half practical)
-	it is SQL service, and used for taking backup auto/manual snapshot
-	multiAZ will do synchronised replication during failover db maintenance/instance failure/AZ failure. it will automatically switch to standby db on another AZ
-	readIntensiveLoad will have only 5ReadReplications of 1 DB, those are only used for read purpose where asynchronous replication is done. 
Elastic Cache(no-practical)
-	inMemoryCache used to retrieve info faster, rather than making requests to the server and it is temporary storage. used for read heavy requests.
Simple Queue Service(no-practical)
-	queue system used to store messages(requests) and the application server will process them. It's pull based. Decouple and Long Polling
-	VisibilityTimeOut will take care if msg is processed or not messages are stored in Standard Queue or FirstInFirstOut order.
Simple Email Service(no-practical)
-	used to send and receive email for marketing, notification,and transactional email
